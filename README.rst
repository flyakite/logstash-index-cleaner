Project history
---------------

This is a fork of https://github.com/crashdump/logstash-elasticsearch-scripts.

Since ElasticSearch 0.90 all fields are compressed, and some benchmarks show that
nothing improves optimizing those already compressed indices. That's why this fork
does not include the original `logstash_index_optimize.py`

Optimizations references:
